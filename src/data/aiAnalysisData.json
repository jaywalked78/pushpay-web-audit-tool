          "description": "Provide concise and descriptive `alt` attributes for all functional or informational images (e.g., \"Pushpay Logo\", \"Donor Insights Icon\"). For purely decorative images, ensure `alt=\"\"` is used. Replace all generic alt text with meaningful descriptions. || Action 2: Replace `href=\"#\"` with functional URLs if they lead to distinct pages (e.g., `/search` for a search page). If they trigger JavaScript functions (e.g., opening a modal), convert them to `<button>` elements and use appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) to convey their purpose and state to assistive technologies. || Action 3: Add an `aria-label` attribute directly to the `<input>` tag that describes its purpose (e.g., `aria-label=\"Search website\"`), or use a visually hidden `<label>` element associated with the input via its `for` attribute. || Action 4: Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the first focusable element immediately after the `<body>` tag. This link should become visible on keyboard focus (`:focus` pseudo-class) and, when activated, smoothly move focus to the main content area (e.g., `<main id=\"main-content\">`). || Action 5: Increase the effective clickable area of all interactive elements to at least 44x44 CSS pixels. This can be achieved by increasing padding on buttons/links or setting a minimum `width` and `min-height` in CSS. Ensure the visual feedback (e.g., hover/active states) is also applied to this larger area. || Action 6: If the content of the Marketo form is intended for SEO, consider alternative hiding methods that are less likely to be seen as manipulative, such as `visibility:hidden` or `opacity:0` coupled with `aria-hidden=\"true\"` instead of `display:none`. Otherwise, ensure such content is either not critical for SEO or made visible through other means. || Action 7: Minimize render-blocking JavaScript by implementing `defer` or `async` attributes for scripts that are not critical for the immediate visual rendering of the page. Consolidate small, non-critical inline scripts into external files to reduce HTTP requests or, if truly tiny and critical, inline them carefully. Prioritize loading essential scripts first. || Action 8: Consolidate all inline CSS into external stylesheet files. Leverage CSS classes and IDs for styling, rather than inline `style` attributes. Remove or refactor `!important` flags where possible to allow for proper CSS cascade and easier overrides. This improves caching, reduces HTML size, and enhances maintainability. || Action 9: Replace generic anchor text with descriptive, keyword-rich phrases that accurately reflect the content or action of the linked page. For example, 'Request a Free Demo of Donor Development Software' or 'Start Your Self-guided Tour of Donor Insights'. || Action 10: Re-evaluate the semantic role of these elements. If they are primary feature titles, consider using H3 or H4 if appropriate, ensuring a logical descending order. The images within headings should ideally be separate elements or styled with CSS background images to maintain clean semantic markup. || Action 11: Apply text styling consistently using CSS classes defined in external stylesheets. Avoid inline `style` attributes for common text styling. This improves code maintainability, consistency, and slightly aids performance.",

For purely decorative images, ensure `alt=\"\"` is used. Review all generic `alt` text and replace with meaningful descriptions. || Action 2: Replace `href=\"#\"` with functional URLs if they lead to distinct pages (e.g., `/search` for a search page). If they trigger JavaScript functions (e.g., opening a modal), convert them to `<button>` elements and use appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) to convey their purpose and state to assistive technologies. || Action 3: Add an `aria-label` attribute directly to the `<input>` tag that describes its purpose, or use a visually hidden `<label>` element associated with the input via its `for` attribute. || Action 4: If the content of the Marketo form is intended for SEO, consider alternative hiding methods that are less likely to be seen as manipulative, such as `visibility:hidden` or `opacity:0` combined with `aria-hidden=\"true\"` if it's meant to be truly inaccessible to all users until activated. Otherwise, ensure such content is either not critical for SEO or made visible through other means. || Action 5: Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the first focusable element immediately after the `<body>` tag. This link should become visible on keyboard focus (`:focus` pseudo-class) and, when activated, smoothly move focus to the main content area (e.g., `<main id=\"main-content\">`). || Action 6: Minimize render-blocking JavaScript by implementing `defer` or `async` attributes for scripts that are not critical for the immediate visual rendering of the page. Consolidate small, non-critical inline scripts into external files to reduce HTTP requests or, if truly tiny and critical, inline them carefully. Prioritize loading essential scripts first. || Action 7: Increase the effective clickable area of all interactive elements to at least 44x44 CSS pixels. This can be achieved by increasing padding on buttons/links or setting a minimum `width` and `min-height` in CSS. Ensure the visual feedback (e.g., hover/active states) is also applied to this larger area. || Action 8: Replace generic anchor text with descriptive, keyword-rich phrases that accurately reflect the content of the linked page. For example, instead of 'Click here', use 'Access ChMS Support Portal' or 'Explore Pushpay University Resources'. || Action 9: Consolidate all inline CSS into external stylesheet files. Leverage CSS classes and IDs for styling, rather than inline `style` attributes. Remove or refactor `!important` flags where possible to allow for proper CSS cascade and easier overrides. This improves caching, reduces HTML size, and enhances maintainability. || Action 10: Apply styling consistently using CSS classes defined in external stylesheets. Avoid inline `style` attributes on generic elements like `<span>` for common text styling. This improves code maintainability, consistency, and slightly aids performance.",

          "description": "Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the very first interactive element in the `<body>`, which becomes visible on focus and jumps to the `main` content area. This is a crucial WCAG 2.1 A/AA requirement. || Action 2: Refactor the entire heading hierarchy. Ensure only one `<h1>` per page, representing the main topic. Remove presentational HTML like `<sup>®</sup>` and `<br />` from headings (use CSS for styling). Convert descriptive `h2`s to `<p>` tags and misuse of `h5`/`h6` to semantically neutral elements (e.g., `div`, `span`) with appropriate CSS classes. Maintain a logical heading flow (H1 > H2 > H3...). || Action 3: Configure the Marketo form directly to include properly associated HTML `<label>` elements for all input fields (using `for` and `id` attributes). Alternatively, if direct label elements cannot be added, use ARIA attributes like `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to provide accessible names for all interactive form controls. || Action 4: Re-engineer the main navigation to ensure all links have valid, crawlable URLs in their `href` attributes. JavaScript should then be used only for progressive enhancements (e.g., smooth dropdown animations) that do not prevent core navigation functionality if JS is unavailable. This ensures robust crawlability and universal accessibility. || Action 5: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all images on the page. For every image, provide a descriptive `alt` attribute that accurately conveys its content or function (e.g., 'Pushpay Logo', 'Giving Feature Icon'). For decorative images, use `alt=\"\"`. For interactive icons (like the comparison table check/ban marks), consider providing context via `aria-label` on the parent element if the image itself is purely visual. Ensure all `src` attributes are populated directly with valid image URLs to reduce JS dependency and improve initial rendering. || Action 6: Perform a comprehensive audit to identify and migrate all inline `style` attributes to external or internal CSS stylesheets. Create and apply descriptive CSS classes to HTML elements instead of inline styles. This will enable proper caching, reduce HTML file size, centralize style management, and improve overall page performance and maintainability. || Action 7: Increase the effective clickable/touchable area of these interactive elements using CSS. Apply sufficient `padding` or set `min-width` and `min-height` (e.g., `44px`) to their parent interactive elements to meet WCAG touch target guidelines. For comparison table icons, ensure their parent `<li>` or `<span>` elements are sufficiently large and clickable. || Action 8: Increase the `font-size` for all text within the comparison table and similar content areas to a minimum of `16px` (or `1rem`) for mobile viewports to ensure comfortable readability without requiring users to manually zoom. || Action 9: Implement a more robust responsive table design strategy for the comparison table. This could involve: 1) making the table horizontally scrollable within its container (using `overflow-x: auto`), 2) completely redesigning the table to stack vertically on smaller screens, or 3) prioritizing essential columns and providing a 'view all' option for additional data. || Action 10: Combine the bold and italic content into a single, semantically appropriate element (e.g., a single `<span>` or `<div>`) and apply styling via CSS classes. Avoid unnecessary `<br>` tags. Ensure all formatting is done through CSS. Review and simplify nested `<span>` elements. || Action 11: Complete the sentence in the `<h3>` tag to make the call to action clear and concise. Ensure the CMS or content entry system allows for full text input for headings. If space is limited, rephrase to be a complete thought. || Action 12: Remove superscript symbols (`<sup>®</sup>`) from headings. If registration marks are absolutely necessary for legal reasons, consider adding them via CSS pseudo-elements for better semantic parsing without affecting the core text content.",

If they trigger JavaScript functions (e.g., opening a modal), convert them to `<button>` elements and use appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) to convey their purpose and state to assistive technologies. || Action 3: Add an `aria-label` attribute directly to the `<input>` tag that describes its purpose (e.g., `aria-label=\"Search website\"`), or use a visually hidden `<label>` element associated with the input via its `for` attribute. || Action 4: Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the first focusable element immediately after the `<body>` tag. This link should become visible on keyboard focus (`:focus` pseudo-class) and, when activated, smoothly move focus to the main content area (e.g., `<main id=\"main-content\">`). || Action 5: Increase the effective clickable area of all interactive elements to at least 44x44 CSS pixels. This can be achieved by increasing padding on buttons/links or setting a minimum `width` and `min-height` in CSS. Ensure the visual feedback (e.g., hover/active states) is also applied to this larger area. || Action 6: If the content of the Marketo form is intended for SEO, consider alternative hiding methods that are less likely to be seen as manipulative, such as `visibility:hidden` or `opacity:0` coupled with `aria-hidden=\"true\"` instead of `display:none`. Otherwise, ensure such content is either not critical for SEO or made visible through other means. || Action 7: Minimize render-blocking JavaScript by implementing `defer` or `async` attributes for scripts that are not critical for the immediate visual rendering of the page. Consolidate small, non-critical inline scripts into external files to reduce HTTP requests or, if truly tiny and critical, inline them carefully. Prioritize loading essential scripts first. || Action 8: Consolidate all inline CSS into external stylesheet files. Leverage CSS classes and IDs for styling, rather than inline `style` attributes. Remove or refactor `!important` flags where possible to allow for proper CSS cascade and easier overrides. This improves caching, reduces HTML size, and enhances maintainability. || Action 9: Replace generic anchor text with descriptive, keyword-rich phrases that accurately reflect the content or action of the linked page. For example, 'Request a Free Demo of Event Management Software' or 'Start Your Self-guided Tour of Facility Management Features'. || Action 10: Re-evaluate the semantic role of these elements.

If they trigger JavaScript functions (e.g., opening a modal), convert them to `<button>` elements and use appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) to convey their purpose and state to assistive technologies. || Action 3: Add an `aria-label` attribute directly to the `<input>` tag that describes its purpose (e.g., `aria-label=\"Search website\"`), or use a visually hidden `<label>` element associated with the input via its `for` attribute. || Action 4: Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the first focusable element immediately after the `<body>` tag. This link should become visible on keyboard focus (`:focus` pseudo-class) and, when activated, smoothly move focus to the main content area (e.g., `<main id=\"main-content\">`). || Action 5: Increase the effective clickable area of all interactive elements to at least 44x44 CSS pixels. This can be achieved by increasing padding on buttons/links or setting a minimum `width` and `min-height` in CSS. Ensure the visual feedback (e.g., hover/active states) is also applied to this larger area. || Action 6: If the content of hidden elements is intended for SEO, consider alternative hiding methods less likely to be seen as manipulative, such as `visibility:hidden` or `opacity:0` coupled with `aria-hidden=\"true\"`. For dynamic content, ensure it's loaded and accessible on user interaction, not just hidden by default for search engines. || Action 7: Minimize render-blocking JavaScript by implementing `defer` or `async` attributes for scripts that are not critical for the immediate visual rendering of the page. Consolidate small, non-critical inline scripts into external files to reduce HTTP requests or, if truly tiny and critical, inline them carefully. Prioritize loading essential scripts first. || Action 8: Consolidate all inline CSS into external stylesheet files. Leverage CSS classes and IDs for styling, rather than inline `style` attributes. Remove or refactor `!important` flags where possible to allow for proper CSS cascade and easier overrides. This improves caching, reduces HTML size, and enhances maintainability. || Action 9: Replace generic anchor text with descriptive, keyword-rich phrases that accurately reflect the content or action of the linked page. For example, 'Request a Free Demo of Parish Reporting Software' or 'View All Parish Success Stories'. || Action 10: Re-evaluate the semantic role of elements. Ensure `h1` is unique and concise (remove `<br />`). Use `h2` and `h3` for main section and sub-section titles in a logical order. Convert `h5` elements used for feature icons/titles to a more appropriate tag like `<div>` or `<span>` with CSS for styling, and ensure icons have proper `alt` text or are background images. Change `h6` navigation titles to non-heading elements like `<li>` or `<p>`. Use CSS for visual line breaks instead of `<br />` tags. || Action 11: Refactor styling to use external CSS classes instead of inline `style` attributes. Define font weights and other typographic styles in a centralized stylesheet. This improves maintainability, caching, and reduces HTML bloat. || Action 12: Populate the `WebSite` schema `description` field with a concise, keyword-rich summary of the entire Pushpay website's purpose and offerings. This can help search engines better understand the overall entity.",

For example, the `font-weight` style should be applied via a class to the entire word or sentence, or externalized in CSS. || Action 2: Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the very first focusable element immediately after the opening `<body>` tag. This link should become visible only when focused (e.g., via keyboard tabbing) and, when activated, should move focus directly to the page's main content area (e.g., `<main id=\"main-content\">`). || Action 3: Restructure the page's heading hierarchy to include a single, prominent `<h1>` tag for the main title. The current `<h2>` should be converted to an `<h1>`. The `<h5>` serving as a paragraph should be changed to a `<p>` tag. Ensure all subsequent sections follow a logical nesting order (H1 > H2 > H3, etc.). || Action 4: Configure the Marketo form to ensure all input fields have correctly associated `<label>` elements (using `for` and `id` attributes) or appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`) for accessibility. This is a critical step for WCAG compliance. || Action 5: Re-architect the main navigation to use valid, crawlable URLs in `href` attributes for all links. Implement JavaScript for progressive enhancement (e.g., creating animated dropdowns or overlays) rather than as the sole mechanism for navigation functionality. This ensures a robust, crawlable, and accessible navigation experience. || Action 6: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all images on the page and provide descriptive `alt` attributes that accurately convey the image's content or function. For logos, specify 'Pushpay Logo'. For functional icons in navigation, describe their purpose (e.g., 'Giving Product Page Icon'). || Action 7: Increase the effective clickable/touchable area of the social media icons using CSS. Apply sufficient `padding` (e.g., `padding: 12px;`) or set `min-width` and `min-height` (e.g., `min-width: 44px; min-height: 44px;`) to their parent `<a>` elements to meet WCAG touch target guidelines. || Action 8: Remove all extraneous social media IDs and other non-essential text from the `<title>` tag. This typically requires adjusting settings within the Yoast SEO Premium plugin or the custom function responsible for generating page titles. || Action 9: Refactor all inline styles into external or internal CSS stylesheets. Define descriptive classes for common styling patterns (e.g., `.intro-text`, `.button-spacing`, `.centered-heading`) and apply these classes to the HTML elements instead of inline `style` attributes.

For purely decorative images, ensure `alt=\"\"` is used. Replace all generic alt text with meaningful descriptions. || Action 2: Replace `href=\"#\"` with functional URLs if they lead to distinct pages (e.g., `/search` for a search page). If they trigger JavaScript functions (e.g., opening a modal), convert them to `<button>` elements and use appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) to convey their purpose and state to assistive technologies. || Action 3: Add an `aria-label` attribute directly to the `<input>` tag that describes its purpose (e.g., `aria-label=\"Search website\"`), or use a visually hidden `<label>` element associated with the input via its `for` attribute. || Action 4: Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the first focusable element immediately after the `<body>` tag. This link should become visible on keyboard focus (`:focus` pseudo-class) and, when activated, smoothly move focus to the main content area (e.g., `<main id=\"main-content\">`). || Action 5: Increase the effective clickable area of all interactive elements to at least 44x44 CSS pixels. This can be achieved by increasing padding on buttons/links or setting a minimum `width` and `min-height` in CSS. Ensure the visual feedback (e.g., hover/active states) is also applied to this larger area. || Action 6: If the content of hidden elements is intended for SEO, consider alternative hiding methods less likely to be seen as manipulative, such as `visibility:hidden` or `opacity:0` coupled with `aria-hidden=\"true\"`. For dynamic content, ensure it's loaded and accessible on user interaction, not just hidden by default for search engines. || Action 7: Minimize render-blocking JavaScript by implementing `defer` or `async` attributes for scripts that are not critical for the immediate visual rendering of the page. Consolidate small, non-critical inline scripts into external files to reduce HTTP requests or, if truly tiny and critical, inline them carefully. Prioritize loading essential scripts first. || Action 8: Consolidate all inline CSS into external stylesheet files. Leverage CSS classes and IDs for styling, rather than inline `style` attributes. Remove or refactor `!important` flags where possible to allow for proper CSS cascade and easier overrides. This improves caching, reduces HTML size, and enhances maintainability. || Action 9: Replace generic anchor text with descriptive, keyword-rich phrases that accurately reflect the content or action of the linked page. For example, 'Request a Free Demo of Volunteer Software' or 'View All Customer Stories'. || Action 10: Re-evaluate the semantic role of these elements. If they are primary feature titles, consider using H3 or H4 if appropriate, ensuring a logical descending order. The images within headings should ideally be separated into distinct elements or implemented as CSS background images to maintain clean semantic markup.",

This is a crucial WCAG 2.1 AA requirement. || Action 2: Refactor the heading structure. The introductory paragraph should remain a `<p>` tag. Introduce main sections under the `<h1>` with `<h2>` tags, and then use `<h3>` for sub-sections. Remove the `<br />` tag from the `h1` and use CSS for line breaks if needed. || Action 3: Configure the Marketo form to ensure all input fields have correctly associated `<label>` elements (using `for` and `id` attributes) or appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`). This is crucial for WCAG compliance. || Action 4: Re-architect the main navigation to use valid, crawlable URLs in `href` attributes for all links.

This is a crucial WCAG 2.1 A/AA requirement. || Action 2: Refactor the entire heading hierarchy. Ensure only one `<h1>` per page, representing the main topic. Remove presentational HTML like `<sup>®</sup>` and `<br />` from headings (use CSS for styling). Convert descriptive `h2`s to `<p>` tags and misuse of `h5`/`h6` to semantically neutral elements (e.g., `div`, `span`) with appropriate CSS classes. Maintain a logical heading flow (H1 > H2 > H3...). || Action 3: Configure the Marketo form directly to include properly associated HTML `<label>` elements for all input fields (using `for` and `id` attributes). Alternatively, if direct label elements cannot be added, use ARIA attributes like `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to provide accessible names for all interactive form controls. || Action 4: Re-engineer the main navigation to ensure all links have valid, crawlable URLs in their `href` attributes. JavaScript should then be used only for progressive enhancements (e.g., smooth dropdown animations) that do not prevent core navigation functionality if JS is unavailable. This ensures robust crawlability and universal accessibility. || Action 5: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all images on the page. For every image, provide a descriptive `alt` attribute that accurately conveys its content or function (e.g., 'Pushpay Logo', 'Giving Feature Icon'). For decorative images, use `alt=\"\"`. For interactive icons (like the comparison table check/ban marks), consider providing context via `aria-label` on the parent element if the image itself is purely visual. Ensure all `src` attributes are populated directly with valid image URLs to reduce JS dependency and improve initial rendering. || Action 6: Perform a comprehensive audit to identify and migrate all inline `style` attributes to external or internal CSS stylesheets. Create and apply descriptive CSS classes to HTML elements instead of inline styles. This will enable proper caching, reduce HTML file size, centralize style management, and improve overall page performance and maintainability. || Action 7: Increase the effective clickable/touchable area of these interactive elements using CSS. Apply sufficient `padding` or set `min-width` and `min-height` (e.g., `44px`) to their parent interactive elements to meet WCAG touch target guidelines. For comparison table icons, ensure their parent `<li>` or `<span>` elements are sufficiently large and clickable. || Action 8: Increase the `font-size` for all text within the comparison table and similar content areas to a minimum of `16px` (or `1rem`) for mobile viewports to ensure comfortable readability without requiring users to manually zoom. || Action 9: Implement a more robust responsive table design strategy for the comparison table. This could involve: 1) making the table horizontally scrollable within its container (using `overflow-x: auto`), 2) completely redesigning the table to stack vertically on smaller screens, or 3) prioritizing essential columns and providing a 'view all' option for additional data. || Action 10: Combine the bold and italic content into a single, semantically appropriate element (e.g., a single `<span>` or `<div>`) and apply styling via CSS classes. Avoid unnecessary `<br>` tags. Ensure all formatting is done through CSS. Review and simplify nested `<span>` elements. || Action 11: Complete the sentence in the `<h3>` tag to make the call to action clear and concise. Ensure the CMS or content entry system allows for full text input for headings. If space is limited, rephrase to be a complete thought. || Action 12: Remove superscript symbols (`™`, `®`) from headings. If these registration marks are absolutely necessary for legal or branding reasons, consider adding them via CSS pseudo-elements for better semantic parsing without affecting the core text content.",

For buttons, ensure proper ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) are used to convey their state and purpose to assistive technologies. || Action 3: Add a visually hidden `<label>` element associated with the input using `for` attribute, or an `aria-label` attribute directly on the input. `aria-label` is simpler for a single input. || Action 4: If the content of the Marketo form is critical for SEO, consider alternative hiding methods that are less likely to be seen as manipulative, such as `visibility:hidden` or `opacity:0` combined with `aria-hidden=\"true\"` if it's meant to be truly inaccessible to all users until activated. Ideally, if the content is meant for indexing, it should be visible in the initial render. || Action 5: Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the first focusable element in the `<body>` tag. This link should become visible on keyboard focus and, when activated, move focus to the main content area (e.g., `<main id=\"main-content\">`). || Action 6: Minimize render-blocking JavaScript by deferring (using `defer` attribute) or asynchronously loading (`async` attribute) scripts that are not critical for initial page rendering. For very small, critical scripts, consider inlining them directly into the HTML to reduce HTTP requests, but large inline scripts should be externalized and optimized.",

This is a crucial WCAG 2.1 AA requirement. || Action 2: Correct the heading hierarchy to be logical (H1, followed by H2s, then H3s etc.). The `<h5>` serving as a paragraph should be changed to a `<p>` tag. Ensure main sections within the guide are introduced by an `<h2>`. || Action 3: Configure the Marketo form to ensure all input fields have explicitly associated `<label>` elements (using `for` and `id` attributes) or appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`) for accessibility. This is a critical step for WCAG compliance. || Action 4: Re-architect the main navigation to use valid, crawlable URLs in `href` attributes for all links. Implement JavaScript for progressive enhancement (e.g., dropdowns) rather than as the sole mechanism for navigation functionality. This ensures both accessibility and robust crawlability. || Action 5: Conduct a thorough audit of all images and provide descriptive `alt` attributes that accurately convey the image's content or function. For decorative images, `alt=\"\"` is appropriate, but for functional elements like logos, use `alt=\"Pushpay Logo\"`. For icons representing features, use `alt=\"[Feature Name] Icon\"`. Also, ensure `src` attributes are properly populated. || Action 6: Remove extraneous social media IDs and any other non-essential text from the `<title>` tag. This typically requires adjusting settings within the Yoast SEO Premium plugin or the custom function responsible for generating page titles. || Action 7: Add a `<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"[URL to a high-quality, relevant image]\">` tag within the `<head>` section. Ensure the image is optimized for social sharing (e.g., aspect ratio 1.91:1, minimum 1200x630 pixels). || Action 8: Increase the effective clickable/touchable area of the social media icons using CSS. Apply sufficient `padding` (e.g., `padding: 12px;`) or set `min-width` and `min-height` (e.g., `min-width: 44px; min-height: 44px;`) to their parent `<a>` elements to meet WCAG touch target guidelines. || Action 9: Relocate all inline styles to external or internal CSS stylesheets. Define descriptive classes for common styling patterns (e.g., `.centered-text`, `.spacer-25px`, `.button-left-margin`) and apply these classes to the HTML elements instead of inline `style` attributes.

This is a crucial WCAG 2.1 AA requirement. || Action 2: Refactor the entire heading hierarchy. Ensure only one `<h1>` per page, and it should accurately represent the main topic. Use `<h2>` for primary sections, `<h3>` for sub-sections, and so on. Replace misused `h` tags with semantically appropriate elements (e.g., `<p>`, `<div>`, `<span>`) styled with CSS. Remove inline `<br />` from headings and use CSS for visual line breaks. || Action 3: Configure the Marketo form directly to include properly associated HTML `<label>` elements for all input fields (using `for` and `id` attributes). Alternatively, if direct label elements cannot be added, use ARIA attributes like `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to provide accessible names for all interactive form controls. || Action 4: Re-engineer the main navigation to ensure all links have valid, crawlable URLs in their `href` attributes. JavaScript should then be used only for progressive enhancements (e.g., smooth dropdown animations or interactive elements) that do not prevent core navigation functionality if JS is unavailable. This ensures robust crawlability and universal accessibility. || Action 5: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all images on the page. For every image, provide a descriptive `alt` attribute that accurately conveys its content or function (e.g., 'Pushpay Logo', 'Giving Feature Icon'). For decorative images, use `alt=\"\"`. For interactive icons (like the comparison table check/ban marks), consider providing context via `aria-label` on the parent element if the image itself is purely visual. Ensure all `src` attributes are populated directly with valid image URLs to reduce JS dependency and improve initial rendering. || Action 6: Perform a comprehensive audit to identify and migrate all inline `style` attributes to external or internal CSS stylesheets. Create and apply descriptive CSS classes to HTML elements instead of inline styles. This will enable proper caching, reduce HTML file size, centralize style management, and improve overall page performance and maintainability. || Action 7: Increase the effective clickable/touchable area of these interactive elements using CSS. Apply sufficient `padding` (e.g., `padding: 12px;`) or set `min-width` and `min-height` (e.g., `min-width: 44px; min-height: 44px;`) to their parent `<a>` or `<button>` elements to meet WCAG touch target guidelines. For comparison table icons, ensure their parent `<li>` or `<span>` elements are sufficiently large and clickable. || Action 8: Combine the `<b>` and `<em>` content into a single, semantically appropriate element (e.g., a single `<span>` or `<div>`) and apply styling via CSS classes. Avoid unnecessary `<br>` tags. Ensure all formatting is done through CSS. Use `<strong>` instead of `<b>` for emphasis where appropriate. || Action 9: Remove superscript symbols (`<sup>®</sup>`) from headings. If registration marks are absolutely necessary for legal reasons, consider adding them via CSS pseudo-elements for better semantic parsing. || Action 10: Increase the `font-size` for all text within the comparison table and similar content areas to a minimum of `16px` (or `1rem`) for mobile viewports to ensure comfortable readability without requiring users to manually zoom. || Action 11: Implement a more robust responsive table design strategy for the comparison table. This could include: 1) making the table horizontally scrollable within its container (using `overflow-x: auto`) for all small screens, 2) completely re-designing the table to stack vertically on smaller screens, or 3) prioritizing only essential columns and providing a 'view all' option for additional data. || Action 12: Complete the sentence in the `<h3>` tag to make the call to action clear and concise. Ensure the CMS or content entry system allows for full text input for headings. If space is limited, rephrase to be a complete thought.",

For purely decorative images, ensure `alt=\"\"` is used. Replace all generic alt text with meaningful descriptions. || Action 2: Replace `href=\"#\"` with functional URLs if they lead to distinct pages (e.g., `/search` for a search page). If they trigger JavaScript functions (e.g., opening a modal), convert them to `<button>` elements and use appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) to convey their purpose and state to assistive technologies. || Action 3: Add an `aria-label` attribute directly to the `<input>` tag that describes its purpose (e.g., `aria-label=\"Search website\"`), or use a visually hidden `<label>` element associated with the input via its `for` attribute. || Action 4: Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the first focusable element immediately after the `<body>` tag. This link should become visible on keyboard focus (`:focus` pseudo-class) and, when activated, smoothly move focus to the main content area (e.g., `<main id=\"main-content\">`). || Action 5: Increase the effective clickable area of all interactive elements to at least 44x44 CSS pixels. This can be achieved by increasing padding on buttons/links or setting a minimum `width` and `min-height` in CSS. Ensure the visual feedback (e.g., hover/active states) is also applied to this larger area. || Action 6: If the content of hidden elements is intended for SEO, consider alternative hiding methods less likely to be seen as manipulative, such as `visibility:hidden` or `opacity:0` coupled with `aria-hidden=\"true\"`. For dynamic content, ensure it's loaded and accessible on user interaction, not just hidden by default for search engines. || Action 7: Minimize render-blocking JavaScript by implementing `defer` or `async` attributes for scripts that are not critical for the immediate visual rendering of the page. Consolidate small, non-critical inline scripts into external files to reduce HTTP requests or, if truly tiny and critical, inline them carefully. Prioritize loading essential scripts first. || Action 8: Consolidate all inline CSS into external stylesheet files. Leverage CSS classes and IDs for styling, rather than inline `style` attributes. Remove or refactor `!important` flags where possible to allow for proper CSS cascade and easier overrides. This improves caching, reduces HTML size, and enhances maintainability. || Action 9: Replace generic anchor text with descriptive, keyword-rich phrases that accurately reflect the content or action of the linked page. For example, 'Request a Free Demo of Reporting Software' or 'View All Client Testimonials'. || Action 10: Re-evaluate the semantic role of these elements. If they are primary feature titles, consider using H3 or H4 if appropriate, ensuring a logical descending order. The images within headings should ideally be separated into distinct elements or implemented as CSS background images to maintain clean semantic markup. Navigation titles should be `<li>` elements, not headings. || Action 11: Apply text styling consistently using CSS classes defined in external stylesheets. Avoid inline `style` attributes for common text styling. This improves code maintainability, consistency, and slightly aids performance.",

For buttons, ensure proper ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) are used to convey their state and purpose to assistive technologies. || Action 3: Add a visually hidden `<label>` element associated with the input using `for` attribute, or an `aria-label` attribute directly on the input. `aria-label` is often simpler for a single input. || Action 4: If the content of the Marketo form is critical for SEO, consider alternative hiding methods that are less likely to be seen as manipulative, such as `visibility:hidden` or `opacity:0` combined with `aria-hidden=\"true\"` if it's meant to be truly inaccessible to all users until activated.

This can often be achieved by increasing padding or min-width/min-height in CSS without changing the visual size of the icon itself. || Action 8: Replace generic anchor text with descriptive phrases that clearly indicate the content of the linked page. For example, instead of 'Click here', use 'Explore ChMS Support' or 'Access Pushpay University Resources'.",

This is a crucial WCAG 2.1 A/AA requirement. || Action 2: Refactor the entire heading hierarchy. Ensure only one `<h1>` per page, representing the main topic. Remove presentational HTML like `<sup>®</sup>` and `<br />` from headings (use CSS for styling). Convert descriptive `h2`s to `<p>` tags and misuse of `h5`/`h6` to semantically neutral elements (e.g., `div`, `span`) with appropriate CSS classes. Maintain a logical heading flow (H1 > H2 > H3...). || Action 3: Configure the Marketo form directly to include properly associated HTML `<label>` elements for all input fields (using `for` and `id` attributes). Alternatively, if direct label elements cannot be added, use ARIA attributes like `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to provide accessible names for all interactive form controls. || Action 4: Re-engineer the main navigation to ensure all links have valid, crawlable URLs in their `href` attributes. JavaScript should then be used only for progressive enhancements (e.g., smooth dropdown animations) that do not prevent core navigation functionality if JS is unavailable. This ensures robust crawlability and universal accessibility. || Action 5: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all images on the page. For every image, provide a descriptive `alt` attribute that accurately conveys its content or function (e.g., 'Pushpay Logo', 'Giving Feature Icon'). For decorative images, use `alt=\"\"`. For interactive icons (like the comparison table check/ban marks), consider providing context via `aria-label` on the parent element if the image itself is purely visual. Ensure all `src` attributes are populated directly with valid image URLs to reduce JS dependency and improve initial rendering. || Action 6: Perform a comprehensive audit to identify and migrate all inline `style` attributes to external or internal CSS stylesheets. Create and apply descriptive CSS classes to HTML elements instead of inline styles. This will enable proper caching, reduce HTML file size, centralize style management, and improve overall page performance and maintainability. || Action 7: Increase the effective clickable/touchable area of these interactive elements using CSS. Apply sufficient `padding` or set `min-width` and `min-height` (e.g., `44px`) to their parent interactive elements to meet WCAG touch target guidelines. For comparison table icons, ensure their parent `<li>` or `<span>` elements are sufficiently large and clickable. || Action 8: Increase the `font-size` for all text within the comparison table and similar content areas to a minimum of `16px` (or `1rem`) for mobile viewports to ensure comfortable readability without requiring users to manually zoom. || Action 9: Implement a more robust responsive table design strategy for the comparison table. This could involve: 1) making the table horizontally scrollable within its container (using `overflow-x: auto`), 2) completely redesigning the table to stack vertically on smaller screens, or 3) prioritizing essential columns and providing a 'view all' option for additional data. || Action 10: Combine the bold and italic content into a single, semantically appropriate element (e.g., a single `<span>` or `<div>`) and apply styling via CSS classes. Avoid unnecessary `<br>` tags. Ensure all formatting is done through CSS. Review and simplify nested `<span>` elements. || Action 11: Complete the sentence in the `<h3>` tag to make the call to action clear and concise. Ensure the CMS or content entry system allows for full text input for headings. If space is limited, rephrase to be a complete thought. || Action 12: Remove superscript symbols (`®`, `™`) from headings and extraneous social media IDs from the title tag. If registration marks are absolutely necessary for legal or branding reasons, consider adding them via CSS pseudo-elements for better semantic parsing without affecting the core text content.",

Apply sufficient `padding` (e.g., `padding: 12px;`) or set `min-width` and `min-height` (e.g., `min-width: 44px; min-height: 44px;`) to their parent `<a>` or `<button>` elements to meet WCAG touch target guidelines. || Action 8: Remove unnecessary `<span>` wrappers from paragraphs. Apply styling (like `font-weight`) directly to the `<p>` tag or via a CSS class on the `<p>` element. This improves semantic markup, maintainability, and potentially rendering efficiency. || Action 9: Relocate all inline styles to external or internal CSS stylesheets. Define descriptive classes for common styling patterns (e.g., `.intro-paragraph`, `.button-with-margin`) and apply these classes to the HTML elements instead of inline `style` attributes. This improves caching, maintainability, and code organization.",
