      "description": "Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the very first interactive element in the `<body>`, which becomes visible on focus and jumps to the `main` content area. This is a crucial WCAG 2.1 AA requirement. || Action 2: Refactor the heading structure. The introductory paragraph should remain a `<p>` tag. Introduce main sections under the `<h1>` with `<h2>` tags, and then use `<h3>` for sub-sections. Remove the `<br />` tag from the `h1` and use CSS for line breaks if needed. || Action 3: Configure the Marketo form to ensure all input fields have correctly associated `<label>` elements (using `for` and `id` attributes) or appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`). This is crucial for WCAG compliance. || Action 4: Re-architect the main navigation to use valid, crawlable URLs in `href` attributes for all links. Implement JavaScript for progressive enhancement (e.g., dropdowns) rather than as the sole mechanism for navigation functionality. This ensures both accessibility and robust crawlability. || Action 5: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all images and provide descriptive `alt` attributes that accurately convey their content or function. For logos, use \"Pushpay Logo\". For functional icons, describe their purpose. Ensure all `src` attributes are correctly populated with valid image URLs. || Action 6: Remove all extraneous social media IDs and other non-essential text from the `<title>` tag. This likely requires adjusting settings within the Yoast SEO Premium plugin or the custom function generating page titles. || Action 7: Increase the effective clickable/touchable area of these interactive elements using CSS. Apply sufficient `padding` (e.g., `padding: 12px;`) or set `min-width` and `min-height` (e.g., `min-width: 44px; min-height: 44px;`) to their parent `<a>` or `<button>` elements to meet WCAG touch target guidelines. || Action 8: Remove unnecessary `<span>` wrappers from paragraphs and apply styling (like `font-weight`) directly to the `<p>` tag or via a CSS class. Replace `div` elements used solely for spacing with appropriate CSS margins/paddings on surrounding elements or, if a specific space-only element is truly needed, use a semantically neutral element with a class (e.g., `<div class=\"spacer-25px\">`) and define the height in CSS.",
