      "description": "Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the very first interactive element in the `<body>`, which becomes visible on focus and jumps to the `main` content area. This is a crucial WCAG 2.1 AA requirement. || Action 2: Restructure the heading hierarchy: Convert the main `<h2>` to an `<h1>`. Change the `<h5>` to a `<p>`. Ensure main content sections are introduced by `<h2>`s, and `<h3>` tags are used only for true sub-sections, not labels. Use semantically neutral elements (e.g., `div` or `span`) for stylistic labels. || Action 3: Configure the Marketo form to ensure all input fields have correctly associated `<label>` elements (using `for` and `id` attributes) or appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`). This is crucial for WCAG compliance. || Action 4: Refactor navigation elements to use valid, crawlable URLs in `href` attributes. Use JavaScript for progressive enhancement (e.g., dropdown animations) rather than as the sole mechanism for navigation. || Action 5: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all images and provide descriptive `alt` attributes. For functional images, describe their purpose. Ensure all `src` attributes are correctly populated with valid image URLs. || Action 6: Remove all extraneous social media IDs and other non-essential text from the `<title>` tag. This typically requires adjusting settings within the Yoast SEO Premium plugin or the custom function generating page titles. || Action 7: Add a `<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"[URL to a high-quality, relevant image]\">` tag within the `<head>` section. Ensure the image is optimized for social sharing (e.g., aspect ratio 1.91:1, minimum 1200x630 pixels). || Action 8: Increase the effective clickable/touchable area of these interactive elements using CSS. Apply sufficient `padding` (e.g., `padding: 12px;`) or set `min-width` and `min-height` (e.g., `min-width: 44px; min-height: 44px;`) to their parent `<a>` or `<button>` elements to meet WCAG touch target guidelines. || Action 9: Remove unnecessary `<span>` wrappers from paragraphs and apply styling (like `font-weight`) directly to the `<p>` tag or via a CSS class. Replace `div` elements used solely for spacing with appropriate CSS margins/paddings on surrounding elements or use a semantically neutral element with a class for styling (e.g., `<div class=\"spacer-25px\">`).",
