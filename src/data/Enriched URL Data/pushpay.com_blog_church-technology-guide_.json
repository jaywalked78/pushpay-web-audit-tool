      "description": "Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the very first interactive element in the `<body>`, which becomes visible on focus and jumps to the `main` content area. This is a crucial WCAG 2.1 AA requirement. || Action 2: Implement an `<h1>` tag for the primary page title. Demote the current `<h2>` to a `<h1>`. Ensure all subsequent sections follow a logical heading hierarchy (e.g., `<h2>` for main sections, `<h3>` for sub-sections, etc.). || Action 3: Ensure all input fields within the Marketo form have explicitly associated `<label>` elements (using matching `for` and `id` attributes) or appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`) for accessibility. This typically requires configuration within the Marketo form builder or custom JavaScript to inject labels. || Action 4: Refactor navigation to use valid, crawlable URLs in `href` attributes for all links. Implement JavaScript for progressive enhancement (e.g., dropdowns) rather than as the sole mechanism for navigation functionality. This ensures both accessibility and robust crawlability. || Action 5: Conduct a thorough audit of all images and provide descriptive `alt` attributes that accurately convey the image's content or function. For decorative images, `alt=\"\"` is appropriate, but for functional elements like logos, use `alt=\"Pushpay Logo\"`. For icons representing features, use `alt=\"[Feature Name] Icon\"`. || Action 6: Remove extraneous social media IDs and any other non-essential text from the `<title>` tag. This typically requires adjusting settings within the Yoast SEO Premium plugin or the custom function responsible for generating page titles. || Action 7: Add a `<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"[URL to a high-quality, relevant image]\">` tag within the `<head>` section. Ensure the image is optimized for social sharing (e.g., aspect ratio 1.91:1, minimum 1200x630 pixels) and ideally use an image that represents the page's content, not just a logo. || Action 8: Increase the effective touch target size of these social media icons by applying sufficient CSS `padding` (e.g., `padding: 12px;`) or setting `min-width` and `min-height` of at least `44px` to their parent `<a>` elements. This will make them easier to interact with on touch devices. || Action 9: Relocate all inline styles to external or internal CSS stylesheets. Define classes for common styling patterns (e.g., `.intro-paragraph`, `.button-right-margin`, `.centered-text`) and apply those classes to the HTML elements instead. This improves CSS caching, maintainability, and overall code quality.",
