Implement a proper semantic heading hierarchy (H1-H6) where headings reflect content structure, not just visual styling. Use CSS for visual styling of text that is not a true heading. || Action 2: Remove `minimum-scale=1` and `maximum-scale=1` from the viewport meta tag to allow user scaling. || Action 3: Remove `style=\"display:none;\"` if the content is intended to be visible. If it's a dynamic feature, ensure it's loaded in an accessible manner and not solely hidden from view. || Action 4: Add an explicit `<label>` element associated with the search input, or use an `aria-label` attribute on the input field. || Action 5: Investigate WP Rocket or other optimization plugins for lazy loading configuration. Consolidate inline CSS into external stylesheets. Evaluate critical JS for inline placement vs. deferring/asynchronous loading. Minify and combine external assets. || Action 6: Replace `href=\"#\"` with functional URLs for all navigable items, or use `role=\"button\"` where an actual link is not intended. Revise generic anchor text to be descriptive and keyword-rich, providing clear context of the destination page. || Action 7: Increase the padding or minimum size of interactive elements (especially in the footer navigation and social icons) to meet the 44x44px touch target recommendation, ensuring sufficient space between targets.",
