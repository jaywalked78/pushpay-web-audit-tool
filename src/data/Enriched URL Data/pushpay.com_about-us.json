Refactor HTML to use headings (`h1` through `h6`) strictly for hierarchical content structure. Apply visual styling via CSS classes to non-heading text. || Action 4: Consolidate and externalize inline CSS into dedicated stylesheets. Evaluate inline JavaScript for defer/async loading or externalization. Investigate and debug the lazy loading implementation to ensure images load efficiently. || Action 5: Replace `href=\"#\"` with functional URLs for navigation or use `role=\"button\"` if they trigger dynamic content. Revise generic anchor text to be descriptive of the linked content (e.g., 'Learn about Church Giving'). || Action 6: Implement a visually hidden (but screen reader accessible) 'skip to main content' link at the very beginning of the `<body>` element. || Action 7: Increase the clickable area of these elements through CSS (e.g., `padding`, `min-width`, `min-height`) to meet WCAG 2.5.5 (Target Size) recommendations.",
