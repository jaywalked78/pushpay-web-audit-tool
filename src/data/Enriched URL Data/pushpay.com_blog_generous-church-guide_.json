      "description": "Correct the HTML to prevent internal tags from breaking words. For example, the `font-weight` style should be applied via a class to the entire word or sentence, or externalized in CSS. || Action 2: Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the very first focusable element immediately after the opening `<body>` tag. This link should become visible only when focused (e.g., via keyboard tabbing) and, when activated, should move focus directly to the page's main content area (e.g., `<main id=\"main-content\">`). || Action 3: Restructure the page's heading hierarchy to include a single, prominent `<h1>` tag for the main title. The current `<h2>` should be converted to an `<h1>`. The `<h5>` serving as a paragraph should be changed to a `<p>` tag. Ensure all subsequent sections follow a logical nesting order (H1 > H2 > H3, etc.). || Action 4: Configure the Marketo form to ensure all input fields have correctly associated `<label>` elements (using `for` and `id` attributes) or appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`) for accessibility. This is a critical step for WCAG compliance. || Action 5: Re-architect the main navigation to use valid, crawlable URLs in `href` attributes for all links. Implement JavaScript for progressive enhancement (e.g., creating animated dropdowns or overlays) rather than as the sole mechanism for navigation functionality. This ensures a robust, crawlable, and accessible navigation experience. || Action 6: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all images on the page and provide descriptive `alt` attributes that accurately convey the image's content or function. For logos, specify 'Pushpay Logo'. For functional icons in navigation, describe their purpose (e.g., 'Giving Product Page Icon'). || Action 7: Increase the effective clickable/touchable area of the social media icons using CSS. Apply sufficient `padding` (e.g., `padding: 12px;`) or set `min-width` and `min-height` (e.g., `min-width: 44px; min-height: 44px;`) to their parent `<a>` elements to meet WCAG touch target guidelines. || Action 8: Remove all extraneous social media IDs and other non-essential text from the `<title>` tag. This typically requires adjusting settings within the Yoast SEO Premium plugin or the custom function responsible for generating page titles. || Action 9: Refactor all inline styles into external or internal CSS stylesheets. Define descriptive classes for common styling patterns (e.g., `.intro-text`, `.button-spacing`, `.centered-heading`) and apply these classes to the HTML elements instead of inline `style` attributes. This improves caching, maintainability, and code organization.",
