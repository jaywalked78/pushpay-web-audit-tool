      "description": "Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the very first interactive element in the `<body>`, which becomes visible on focus and jumps to the `main` content area. This is a crucial WCAG 2.1 AA requirement. || Action 2: Correct the heading hierarchy to be logical (H1, followed by H2s, then H3s etc.). The `<h5>` serving as a paragraph should be changed to a `<p>` tag. Ensure main sections within the guide are introduced by an `<h2>`. || Action 3: Configure the Marketo form to ensure all input fields have explicitly associated `<label>` elements (using `for` and `id` attributes) or appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`) for accessibility. This is a critical step for WCAG compliance. || Action 4: Re-architect the main navigation to use valid, crawlable URLs in `href` attributes for all links. Implement JavaScript for progressive enhancement (e.g., dropdowns) rather than as the sole mechanism for navigation functionality. This ensures both accessibility and robust crawlability. || Action 5: Conduct a thorough audit of all images and provide descriptive `alt` attributes that accurately convey the image's content or function. For decorative images, `alt=\"\"` is appropriate, but for functional elements like logos, use `alt=\"Pushpay Logo\"`. For icons representing features, use `alt=\"[Feature Name] Icon\"`. Also, ensure `src` attributes are properly populated. || Action 6: Remove extraneous social media IDs and any other non-essential text from the `<title>` tag. This typically requires adjusting settings within the Yoast SEO Premium plugin or the custom function responsible for generating page titles. || Action 7: Add a `<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"[URL to a high-quality, relevant image]\">` tag within the `<head>` section. Ensure the image is optimized for social sharing (e.g., aspect ratio 1.91:1, minimum 1200x630 pixels). || Action 8: Increase the effective clickable/touchable area of the social media icons using CSS. Apply sufficient `padding` (e.g., `padding: 12px;`) or set `min-width` and `min-height` (e.g., `min-width: 44px; min-height: 44px;`) to their parent `<a>` elements to meet WCAG touch target guidelines. || Action 9: Relocate all inline styles to external or internal CSS stylesheets. Define descriptive classes for common styling patterns (e.g., `.centered-text`, `.spacer-25px`, `.button-left-margin`) and apply these classes to the HTML elements instead of inline `style` attributes. This improves caching, maintainability, and code organization.",
