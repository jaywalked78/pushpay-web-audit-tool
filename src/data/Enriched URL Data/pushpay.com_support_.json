      "description": "Provide concise and descriptive `alt` attributes for all functional or informational images (logos, icons). For decorative images, use `alt=\"\"` but ensure they truly add no content information. || Action 2: Replace `href=\"#\"` with functional URLs where possible (e.g., a search results page for the 'SEARCH' link) or use `<button>` elements for JavaScript-driven functionality that doesn't navigate to a new URL. For buttons, ensure proper ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) are used to convey their state and purpose to assistive technologies. || Action 3: Add a visually hidden `<label>` element associated with the input using `for` attribute, or an `aria-label` attribute directly on the input. `aria-label` is often simpler for a single input. || Action 4: If the content of the Marketo form is critical for SEO, consider alternative hiding methods that are less likely to be seen as manipulative, such as `visibility:hidden` or `opacity:0` combined with `aria-hidden=\"true\"` if it's meant to be truly inaccessible to all users until activated. Ideally, if the content is meant for indexing, it should be visible in the initial render. || Action 5: Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the first focusable element in the `<body>` tag. This link should become visible on keyboard focus and, when activated, move focus to the main content area (e.g., `<main id=\"main-content\">`). || Action 6: Minimize render-blocking JavaScript by deferring (using `defer` attribute) or asynchronously loading (`async` attribute) scripts that are not critical for initial page rendering. For very small, critical scripts, consider inlining them directly into the HTML to reduce HTTP requests, but large inline scripts should be externalized and optimized. || Action 7: Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links, icons) have a minimum touch target size of 44x44 CSS pixels. This can often be achieved by increasing padding or min-width/min-height in CSS without changing the visual size of the icon itself. || Action 8: Replace generic anchor text with descriptive phrases that clearly indicate the content of the linked page. For example, instead of 'Click here', use 'Explore ChMS Support' or 'Access Pushpay University Resources'.",
