      "description": "Provide concise and descriptive `alt` attributes for all images, especially those serving functional or informational purposes (e.g., icons, logos, illustrative images). If an image is purely decorative, `alt=\"\"` is acceptable, but ensure it's truly decorative. || Action 2: Replace `href=\"#\"` with functional URLs where possible (e.g., a search results page for the 'SEARCH' link) or use `<button>` elements for JavaScript-driven functionality that doesn't navigate to a new URL. For buttons, ensure proper ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) are used to convey their state and purpose to assistive technologies. || Action 3: Add a visually hidden `<label>` element associated with the input using `for` attribute, or an `aria-label` attribute directly on the input. `aria-label` is simpler for a single input. || Action 4: If the content of the Marketo form is critical for SEO, consider alternative hiding methods that are less likely to be seen as manipulative, such as `visibility:hidden` or `opacity:0` combined with `aria-hidden=\"true\"` if it's meant to be truly inaccessible to all users until activated. Ideally, if the content is meant for indexing, it should be visible in the initial render. || Action 5: Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the first focusable element in the `<body>` tag. This link should become visible on keyboard focus and, when activated, move focus to the main content area (e.g., `<main id=\"main-content\">`). || Action 6: Minimize render-blocking JavaScript by deferring (using `defer` attribute) or asynchronously loading (`async` attribute) scripts that are not critical for initial page rendering. For very small, critical scripts, consider inlining them directly into the HTML to reduce HTTP requests, but large inline scripts should be externalized and optimized.",
