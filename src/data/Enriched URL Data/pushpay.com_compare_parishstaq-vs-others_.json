      "description": "Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the very first interactive element in the `<body>`, which becomes visible on focus and jumps to the `main` content area. This is a crucial WCAG 2.1 A/AA requirement. || Action 2: Refactor the entire heading hierarchy. Ensure only one `<h1>` per page, representing the main topic. Remove presentational HTML like `<sup>®</sup>` and `<br />` from headings (use CSS for styling). Convert descriptive `h2`s to `<p>` tags and misuse of `h5`/`h6` to semantically neutral elements (e.g., `div`, `span`) with appropriate CSS classes. Maintain a logical heading flow (H1 > H2 > H3...). || Action 3: Configure the Marketo form directly to include properly associated HTML `<label>` elements for all input fields (using `for` and `id` attributes). Alternatively, if direct label elements cannot be added, use ARIA attributes like `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to provide accessible names for all interactive form controls. || Action 4: Re-engineer the main navigation to ensure all links have valid, crawlable URLs in their `href` attributes. JavaScript should then be used only for progressive enhancements (e.g., smooth dropdown animations) that do not prevent core navigation functionality if JS is unavailable. This ensures robust crawlability and universal accessibility. || Action 5: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all images on the page. For every image, provide a descriptive `alt` attribute that accurately conveys its content or function (e.g., 'Pushpay Logo', 'Giving Feature Icon'). For decorative images, use `alt=\"\"`. For interactive icons (like the comparison table check/ban marks), consider providing context via `aria-label` on the parent element if the image itself is purely visual. Ensure all `src` attributes are populated directly with valid image URLs to reduce JS dependency and improve initial rendering. || Action 6: Perform a comprehensive audit to identify and migrate all inline `style` attributes to external or internal CSS stylesheets. Create and apply descriptive CSS classes to HTML elements instead of inline styles. This will enable proper caching, reduce HTML file size, centralize style management, and improve overall page performance and maintainability. || Action 7: Increase the effective clickable/touchable area of these interactive elements using CSS. Apply sufficient `padding` or set `min-width` and `min-height` (e.g., `44px`) to their parent interactive elements to meet WCAG touch target guidelines. For comparison table icons, ensure their parent `<li>` or `<span>` elements are sufficiently large and clickable. || Action 8: Increase the `font-size` for all text within the comparison table and similar content areas to a minimum of `16px` (or `1rem`) for mobile viewports to ensure comfortable readability without requiring users to manually zoom. || Action 9: Implement a more robust responsive table design strategy for the comparison table. This could involve: 1) making the table horizontally scrollable within its container (using `overflow-x: auto`), 2) completely redesigning the table to stack vertically on smaller screens, or 3) prioritizing essential columns and providing a 'view all' option for additional data. || Action 10: Combine the bold and italic content into a single, semantically appropriate element (e.g., a single `<span>` or `<div>`) and apply styling via CSS classes. Avoid unnecessary `<br>` tags. Ensure all formatting is done through CSS. Review and simplify nested `<span>` elements. || Action 11: Complete the sentence in the `<h3>` tag to make the call to action clear and concise. Ensure the CMS or content entry system allows for full text input for headings. If space is limited, rephrase to be a complete thought. || Action 12: Remove superscript symbols (`™`, `®`) from headings. If these registration marks are absolutely necessary for legal or branding reasons, consider adding them via CSS pseudo-elements for better semantic parsing without affecting the core text content.",
