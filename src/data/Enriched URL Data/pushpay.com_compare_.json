      "description": "Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the very first interactive element in the `<body>`, which becomes visible on focus and jumps to the `main` content area. This is a crucial WCAG 2.1 AA requirement. || Action 2: Refactor heading structure: Convert the main `<h2>` to an `<h1>` and remove the `<br />` from `h1` (use CSS). Change `<h5>` (Line 1241) to a `<p>`. Replace all `<h5>`/`<h6>` used for navigation/footer titles with semantically neutral elements (e.g., `div`, `span`) with appropriate CSS classes. || Action 3: Configure the Marketo form to ensure all input fields have correctly associated HTML `<label>` elements (using `for` and `id` attributes) or appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`) for programmatic association. || Action 4: Refactor these navigation elements to use valid, crawlable URLs in their `href` attributes. JavaScript should be used for progressive enhancement (e.g., dropdown animations) rather than as the sole mechanism for navigation. || Action 5: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all images and provide descriptive `alt` attributes. For functional images, describe their purpose. For the comparison table, use `aria-label` or more descriptive hidden text for the icons to convey context (e.g., `aria-label=\"Feature Name: Included\"`). Ensure all `src` attributes are correctly populated with valid image URLs. || Action 6: Remove all extraneous social media IDs and other non-essential text from the `<title>` tag. This typically requires adjusting settings within the Yoast SEO Premium plugin or the custom function generating page titles. || Action 7: Increase the clickable/touchable area of these elements using CSS. Apply sufficient `padding` (e.g., `padding: 12px;`) or set `min-width` and `min-height` (e.g., `min-width: 44px; min-height: 44px;`) to the interactive parent elements (e.g., the `<button>` or `<a>` tag). || Action 8: Refactor HTML to use semantic tags. Remove `<br />` from headings (use CSS). Convert pseudo-buttons (`.compare_link`) to `<a>` or `<button>`. Remove redundant `<span>` wrappers. Externalize all inline `style` attributes into dedicated, cached CSS files using semantic classes. This improves code quality, caching, and maintainability. || Action 9: Increase the `font-size` for all body text and content within tables to a minimum of `16px` (or `1rem`) for mobile viewports to ensure readability without requiring zoom. || Action 10: Implement a more robust responsive table design. This could involve making the table horizontally scrollable within its container (via `overflow-x: auto`), or re-designing it to stack vertically on small screens for better readability without horizontal scrolling. Ensure a seamless experience across all mobile device widths.",
