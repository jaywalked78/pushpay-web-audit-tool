      "description": "Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the very first interactive element in the `<body>`, which becomes visible on focus and jumps to the `main` content area. This is a crucial WCAG 2.1 AA requirement. || Action 2: Correct the heading hierarchy to be logical (H1, followed by H2s, then H3s etc.). Remove the `h5` that acts as a sub-heading to the `h1` and use a `p` tag or appropriate div for descriptive text. Ensure all content sections are introduced by an `h2` where appropriate. Also, remove the `<br />` tag from the H1 for cleaner semantic markup. || Action 3: Ensure all input fields within the Marketo form have explicitly associated `<label>` elements (using `for` and `id` attributes) or appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`) for accessibility. This may require Marketo form configuration or custom JavaScript/HTML injection. || Action 4: Refactor navigation to use valid, crawlable URLs in `href` attributes for all links. Implement JavaScript for progressive enhancement (e.g., dropdowns) rather than as the sole mechanism for navigation functionality. This ensures accessibility and crawlability. || Action 5: Provide descriptive `alt` attributes for all meaningful images. For logos, use 'Company Name Logo'. For functional icons, describe their purpose accurately (e.g., 'Giving Product Icon'). Ensure `src` attributes are not empty. Decorative images can have `alt=\"\"` but functional/content images should convey meaning. || Action 6: Remove extraneous social media IDs and other non-title text from the `<title>` tag. This likely requires adjusting settings in the Yoast SEO Premium plugin or the theme's title generation function. || Action 7: Increase the effective touch target size of these social media icons by applying sufficient CSS `padding` or `min-width`/`min-height` to their parent `<a>` elements, ensuring they meet WCAG 2.1 AA target size guidelines. || Action 8: Move inline styles to external or internal CSS stylesheets. Use semantic HTML elements and CSS properties (like `margin` or `padding`) for spacing instead of empty `<p>&nbsp;</p>` tags or inline `margin` on elements. This improves caching, maintainability, and code quality.",
