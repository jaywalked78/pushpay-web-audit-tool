This is a crucial WCAG 2.1 AA requirement. || Action 2: Implement H2 headings between the H1 and subsequent H3s to maintain a logical and accessible document outline. Ensure all headings follow a sequential order (H1, then H2s, then H3s, etc.). || Action 3: Add a `<label>` element associated with the search input using the `for` attribute, or use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` directly on the input if a visual label is not desired. || Action 4: Provide descriptive `alt` attributes for all meaningful images. For logos, specify 'Company Name Logo'. For functional icons, describe their purpose accurately (e.g., 'Giving Product Icon'). Decorative images can have `alt=\"\"`. || Action 5: Implement robust HTML navigation with actual URLs for top-level links where possible, using JavaScript for progressive enhancement (e.g., dropdowns). Ensure graceful degradation for users with JavaScript disabled. || Action 6: Remove extraneous social media IDs and other non-title text from the `<title>` tag. Configure the SEO plugin (Yoast SEO Premium) or custom function to prevent this concatenation. || Action 7: Increase the effective touch target size of the social media icons using CSS `padding` or `min-width/min-height` on the `<a>` element, ensuring they meet WCAG 2.1 AA requirements (minimum 44x44px).",
