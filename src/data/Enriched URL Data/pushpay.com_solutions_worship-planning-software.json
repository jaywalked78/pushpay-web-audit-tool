      "description": "Provide concise and descriptive `alt` attributes for all functional or informational images (e.g., `alt=\"Pushpay Logo\"`, `alt=\"Service Plan Icon\"`). For purely decorative images, ensure `alt=\"\"` is used. Review all generic `alt` text and replace with meaningful descriptions. || Action 2: Replace `href=\"#\"` with functional URLs if they lead to distinct pages (e.g., `/search` for a search page). If they trigger JavaScript functions (e.g., opening a modal), convert them to `<button>` elements and use appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) to convey their purpose and state to assistive technologies. || Action 3: Add an `aria-label` attribute directly to the `<input>` tag that describes its purpose, or use a visually hidden `<label>` element associated with the input via its `for` attribute. || Action 4: If the content of the Marketo form is intended for SEO, consider alternative hiding methods that are less likely to be seen as manipulative, such as `visibility:hidden` or `opacity:0` combined with `aria-hidden=\"true\"` if it's meant to be truly inaccessible to all users until activated. Otherwise, ensure such content is either not critical for SEO or made visible through other means. || Action 5: Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the first focusable element immediately after the `<body>` tag. This link should become visible on keyboard focus (`:focus` pseudo-class) and, when activated, smoothly move focus to the main content area (e.g., `<main id=\"main-content\">`). || Action 6: Minimize render-blocking JavaScript by implementing `defer` or `async` attributes for scripts that are not critical for the immediate visual rendering of the page. Consolidate small, non-critical inline scripts into external files to reduce HTTP requests or, if truly tiny and critical, inline them carefully. Prioritize loading essential scripts first. || Action 7: Increase the effective clickable area of all interactive elements to at least 44x44 CSS pixels. This can be achieved by increasing padding on buttons/links or setting a minimum `width` and `min-height` in CSS. Ensure the visual feedback (e.g., hover/active states) is also applied to this larger area. || Action 8: Replace generic anchor text with descriptive, keyword-rich phrases that accurately reflect the content of the linked page. For example, instead of 'Click here', use 'Access ChMS Support Portal' or 'Explore Pushpay University Resources'. || Action 9: Consolidate all inline CSS into external stylesheet files. Leverage CSS classes and IDs for styling, rather than inline `style` attributes. Remove or refactor `!important` flags where possible to allow for proper CSS cascade and easier overrides. This improves caching, reduces HTML size, and enhances maintainability. || Action 10: Apply styling consistently using CSS classes defined in external stylesheets. Avoid inline `style` attributes on generic elements like `<span>` for common text styling. This improves code maintainability, consistency, and slightly aids performance.",
