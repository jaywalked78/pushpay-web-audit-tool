      "description": "Replace the image within the H1 with actual text for the main page title ('Careers at Pushpay' or 'Job Openings at Pushpay'). Ensure the H1 directly contains relevant text. If the image is crucial for design, move it outside the H1 and ensure it has a descriptive `alt` attribute. Follow the heading hierarchy by using H2 or H3 tags before an H4. || Action 2: Implement a 'Skip to main content' link as the very first interactive element in the `<body>`, which becomes visible on focus and jumps to the `main` content area. || Action 3: Add a `<label>` element associated with the search input using the `for` attribute, or use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` directly on the input if a visual label is not desired. || Action 4: For top-level navigation items that lead to sub-menus, consider using actual URLs for the main link and implementing progressive enhancement for the dropdowns, ensuring accessibility for non-JavaScript users. Ensure all dynamically loaded navigation images have proper `src` and `alt` attributes. || Action 5: Provide descriptive `alt` attributes for all images, especially logos and navigation icons. For decorative images, `alt=\"\"` is acceptable but ensure meaningful images have proper descriptions. Ensure dynamically loaded images (those with empty `src` attributes) also resolve to valid images with `alt` attributes. || Action 6: Increase the effective touch target size of the social media icons using CSS `padding` or `min-width/height` on the `<a>` element, ensuring they meet WCAG 2.1 AA requirements (44x44px). || Action 7: Align the `og:title` with the page's `<title>` tag for consistency and better social media presentation. || Action 8: Relocate inline styles to external CSS stylesheets for better caching, maintainability, and separation of concerns. This allows browsers to cache the CSS file and apply it across multiple pages.",
