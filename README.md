## 📊 Sample Data Structure

The tool uses structured audit data for consistent analysis:

```javascript
// src/data/bdrData.js
export const bdrData = {
  url: "bdrco.com",
  onpage_score: 98.17,
  meta: {
    cumulative_layout_shift: 0.4039837721090749,
    content: {
      plain_text_word_count: 628,
      plain_text_rate: 0.7634
    },
    internal_links_count: 62,
    external_links_count: 18,
    render_blocking_stylesheets_count: 9
  },
  page_timing: {
    largest_contentful_paint: 2100,
    first_input_delay: 12,
    time_to_interactive: 675
  }
  // ... additional metrics
};
```

## 🎨 Animation System

### **GSAP Implementation**
The tool features sophisticated animations for professional user experience:

#### **Progress Bars**
```javascript
// Staggered loading animations
gsap.fromTo(progressBar, 
  { width: '0%' }, 
  { width: '76%', duration: 1.5, ease: 'power2.out', delay: 1.2 }
);
```

#### **Score Circle**
```javascript
// Synchronized number and circle animation
gsap.to({ value: 0, progress: 0 }, {
  value: 98.2,
  progress: 98.2,
  duration: 2.5,
  ease: 'power2.out',
  onUpdate: function() {
    // Updates number display, circle fill, and colors in real-time
  }
});
```

## 🎯 Business Value Proposition

### **Problem Identification**
- CLS score of 0.404 causes layout shifts during font loading
- Users miss "DISCOVER MORE" call-to-action button
- Direct impact on conversion rates and revenue

### **Quantified Impact**
- **Monthly Loss**: $150,000 from missed conversions
- **Affected Users**: 15% of 10,000 monthly visitors  
- **Lost Opportunities**: 30 coaching clients per month

### **Technical Solution**
- Implement `font-display: swap` for Barlow fonts
- Add font preloading to prevent layout shifts
- Estimated fix time: 2-4 hours of development
